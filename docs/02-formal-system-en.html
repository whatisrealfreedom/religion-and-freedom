        <h1>2. What is an Axiomatic Formal System? ⚙️✨</h1>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Like a mighty tree that builds countless branches of laws and beauty from a few strong roots — but this time for human freedom</strong>
        </blockquote>

        <!-- Important Introduction -->
        <p>This section is crucial because it contains the heart of Jannatkhah's theory. Let's proceed calmly, step by step, like a story, starting from the simplest level to reach the depth. Even if you have no background in philosophy or mathematics, everything will become clear to you by the end of this page.</p>

        <!-- Explanation of Formal System -->
        <h2>First: What Exactly is an Axiomatic Formal System? (Explanation for Everyone)</h2>
        <p>Imagine you want to create a game, like chess. For the game to be fair and stable, you need a few <strong>fundamental rules</strong> that everyone accepts and no one can change. These fundamental rules are called <strong>axioms</strong> (postulates — things we accept without proof because they are self-evident).</p>

        <p>Now an <strong>axiomatic formal system</strong> means an organized and precise structure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Starts with a limited number of axioms</li>
            <li>Builds thousands of new laws from those axioms using simple logical rules (like addition and multiplication in mathematics)</li>
            <li>Always remains stable, has no contradictions, and does not change over time</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is like building a solid building: you place a few main pillars (axioms), then with engineering laws, you raise the entire structure.</p>

        <!-- Geometry Example -->
        <h2>Simple Everyday Example: School Geometry (Euclidean)</h2>
        <p>Remember studying geometry in school? All geometric laws (like the area of a triangle, the Pythagorean theorem) were built from just <strong>5 fundamental principles</strong> (axioms). Let's look at two of them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Axiom 1:</strong> Only one straight line passes through two points. (Simple and self-evident, right?)</li>
            <li><strong>Famous Axiom 5 (Parallel Lines):</strong> If a straight line intersects two other lines and determines the angles, parallel lines never meet.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From these few simple principles, thousands of theorems are built: the area of a circle, the volume of a cube, even the design of bridges and buildings!</p>

        <p>If one of these axioms changes, all of geometry changes — but as long as they remain constant, the system is stable.</p>

        <!-- Numbers Example -->
        <h2>More Advanced Example: Natural Numbers (How All Mathematics is Built)</h2>
        <p>Now let's think about numbers. How can we prove that 2+2=4? From more basic principles!</p>

        <p><strong>Peano's Axioms</strong> (the simplest foundation of mathematics):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>0 is a natural number.</li>
            <li>Every natural number has a "successor" (like 0 → 1, 1 → 2, etc.).</li>
            <li>No two numbers have the same successor.</li>
            <li>If something is true for 0 and all successors, it is true for all numbers (principle of induction).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From these few principles, all addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and even advanced mathematics is built!</p>

        <p>These systems show that with a few solid principles, you can build a complete world without contradictions.</p>

        <!-- The Climax of the Theory -->
        <h2>Now the Climax of the Theory: Religion (Shia Principles) as an Axiomatic Formal System for Freedom</h2>
        <p>Jannatkhah says: The five principles of Shia religion function exactly like these axioms! These are self-evident and divine foundations that build an enduring system for <strong>protecting real freedom (absolute property rights)</strong>.</p>

        <p>These principles are like the roots of a tree, and from them emerge social, legal, and ethical laws for a free society.</p>

        <!-- Complete Table -->
        <h2>Complete Table of the Five Principles</h2>
        <p>Let's examine the table completely and precisely:</p>
        <table>

                <tr>
                    <th>Religious Principle</th>
                    <th>Role as Axiom (Self-Evident Foundation)</th>
                    <th>Complete Explanation for Freedom</th>
                    <th>Final Effect in Real Life</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Tawhid (Monotheism)</strong></td>
                    <td>No real owner except God — humans are only vicegerents (representatives)</td>
                    <td>Governments or humans cannot consider themselves "God" and claim ownership of everything. Humans become legitimate owners of their own body and property.</td>
                    <td>Prevents dictatorship and idolization of power — no government can say "everything belongs to me"</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Nubuwwah (Prophethood)</strong></td>
                    <td>Prophets are practical models of life based on these principles</td>
                    <td>Prophets show how to preserve freedom in practice (like the justice of Ali (AS) or the resistance of Moses (AS)).</td>
                    <td>Real model for a free society — not empty theory</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Ma'ad (Resurrection)</strong></td>
                    <td>Day of final accounting — all actions are returned</td>
                    <td>No oppression is eternal. If someone violates your ownership, justice will ultimately be served.</td>
                    <td>Eliminates fear of enduring oppression — guarantees justice even if the government is corrupt</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Adl (Justice)</strong></td>
                    <td>Fundamental principle of non-aggression (not interfering in others' rights)</td>
                    <td>Foundation of all property rights: no one has the right to interfere in another's body, mind, time, or property.</td>
                    <td>Golden rule of a free society: "My right extends only until it harms your right"</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Imamah/Mahdawiyyah (Imamate/Messianism)</strong></td>
                    <td>A society awaiting a perfectly just leader — ultimate goal of a completely free system</td>
                    <td>A society that awaits the Mahdi (AS) is a society that strives for complete freedom, not a large oppressive government.</td>
                    <td>Ultimate goal: A world without coercion, without an oppressive government — absolute freedom</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <h2>Why is This System Important?</h2>
        <p>This system is the only structure in human history that has endured for thousands of years and always worked for freedom — because its foundation is divine, transcendent, and without contradiction.</p>
